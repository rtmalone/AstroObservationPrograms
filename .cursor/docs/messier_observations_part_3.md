**Brightness:** 6.4  
**Date/Time:** 7-11-23, 11:36 EST

**Brightness:** 8.2  
**Date/Time:** 7-23-22, 10:48 EST

**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Red Dot  
**Notes:** Faint but since there is a lack of stars around it stands out easily. Found a kite pattern of stars with a double star on pattern's left; pan right to find the galaxy.

**Type:** Planetary Nebula  
**Brightness:** 9.9  
**Date/Time:** 2-22-23, 10:26 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)

**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 10.1  
**Date/Time:** 5-10-23, 12:30 EST

**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 7.9  
**Date/Time:** 4-16-23, 11:00 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 5  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Magnification:** 30.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Hopped from Mizar & Alcor to find this target. Finally after 2-3 attempts on other nights. Surprisingly dim considering I have seen dimmer targets more easily. Visually larger than other galaxies. Can't see structures. Had to wait for clouds to pass. Observed with 10mm Plossl too.

## M102 - Spindle Galaxy
**Type:** Lenticular Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 9.9  
**Date/Time:** 5-10-23, 1:13 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Tiny, tiny little ball of faint fuzz. Used the star chart and directions in 110 Things to See... with 25mm eyepiece first to identify surrounding star patterns.

## M103 - Traffic Light Cluster
**Type:** Open Cluster  
**Brightness:** 7.4  
**Date/Time:** 12-29-22, 7:20 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Red Dot  
**Notes:** A very distinct red star in the middle of this cluster; thus the common name of Traffic Light Cluster even if the color is out of order.

## M104 - Sombrero Galaxy
**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 8.0  
**Date/Time:** 4-21-23, 12:08 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 4  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Using observation tips from 110 Things To See With A Telescope I pretty much got dead on the target. I identified the nearby asterism called "The Pistol" to positively identify. Even though these galaxies are almost always faint smudges, I could still see the sombrero personality of this galaxy.

## M105
**Type:** Elliptical Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 9.3  
**Date/Time:** 4-18-23, 11:20 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Magnification:** 30.0x

**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Barlow:** 2x | **Magnification:** 60.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Faint but the familiar smudge characteristic of galaxies was flat. Observed with 2x barlow and 10mm Plossl as well. Found on 1st try by following observation tips. Galaxy was very easy to spot thanks to the quality of tonight's sky!

## M107 - The Crucifix Cluster
**Type:** Globular Cluster  
**Brightness:** 8.1  
**Date/Time:** 7-10-23, 11:52 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 14mm | **Magnification:** 53.6x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Not as tight as other globular clusters & faint!! Sparse starfield but 3 bright stars in a triangle below target in the eyepiece.

## M108 - Surfboard Galaxy
**Type:** Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 10.0  
**Date/Time:** 3-15-23, 10:52 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 4  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Barlow:** 2x | **Magnification:** 150.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Found nearby Owl Nebula with an O III filter and starting with a 25mm eyepiece I knew I had M108 in the view but couldn't see any of its photons yet. I used every trick I could including using my knit cap as a makeshift eye patch to preserve night vision. It worked! I found the faintest of faint smudge and confirmed by a pattern of stars nearby I was looking at M108. Observed with a 10mm and a 2x barlow as well.

## M109 - Vacuum Cleaner Galaxy
**Type:** Barred Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 9.8  
**Date/Time:** 4-18-23, 10:29 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Barlow:** 2x | **Magnification:** 60.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Extremely faint and tiny. Observed with 10mm & 2x barlow also. Kept Phecda out of view so light from star didn't affect eyesight.

## M110
**Type:** Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 8.0  
**Date/Time:** 12-29-22, 7:33 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Magnification:** 30.0x  
**Finder:** Red Dot  
**Notes:** Like most of the DSOs this is a very faint smudge and tiny. Laughably so when compared to nearby Andromeda.
