**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x | **Finder:** Telrad

Just a fuzzy spot though, can't make out the stars in cluster. A little fuzzier than M12 that was found nearby even though it is technically brighter; presumably because it is lower in the sky altitude wise.

---

## M11 - Wild Duck Cluster
**Type:** Open Cluster | **Brightness:** 5.8  
**Date/Time:** 7-11-23, 11:17 EST

**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x | **Finder:** Telrad

Waxing gibbous moon washes out the view a bit but is far from the target; M15 is about average size and fuzzy. A couple brighter stars share the view. Misidentified Enif at first for star hopping, but after correcting easy enough to find.

---

## M16 - Eagle Nebula
**Type:** Star Forming Nebula | **Brightness:** 6.0  
**Date/Time:** 7-11-23, 1:09 EST

**Eyepiece:** 16mm | **Magnification:** 46.9x | **Finder:** Telrad

The Pillars of Creation! J/k, can't see but still exciting. Fainter nebula than others I've observed on the Messier list. But the O III filter helps define the cloud. Looks triangular. There are a few visible stars in the cloud and even those are not as bright as others with in nebula.

---

At first the brightest stars in the cluster looked like an upside down basket. Then I noticed the common name for this DSO - The Cooling Tower. Yep, that's what it looks like. Dense surrounding starfield with relatively bright stars.

---

## M30 - Jellyfish Cluster
**Type:** Globular Cluster | **Brightness:** 7.3  
**Date/Time:** 10-10-23, 7:53 CST  
**Location:** Standing Stone SP (36.47, -85.41)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 7  
**Aperture:** 150mm | **Focal Length:** 750mm  
**Eyepiece:** 9mm | **Magnification:** 83.3x | **Finder:** Telrad

Typical nice bright center of stars, but the outer diffused stars are not as uniform. Looks like a dark shape eats into the bottom (in the eyepiece) of the cluster. Most surrounding stars are few and faint. Except for two: a gold star at 2:00 relative to M30 and a smaller blue star at 9:00.

---

## M31 - Andromeda Galaxy

**Aperture:** 150mm | **Focal Length:** 750mm  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x | **Finder:** Telrad

Identifies object via surrounding star pattern. Yep, just two stars hanging out together; rather dim. Interestingly, I note Stellarium has the magnitude of these two an order dimmer than the book I'm using for the Messier list has them.

---

## M41 - Little Beehive Cluster
**Type:** Open Cluster | **Brightness:** 4.5  
**Date/Time:** 2-10-23, 1:17 AM EST

**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Barlow:** 2x | **Magnification:** 60.0x | **Finder:** Red Dot

Viewed at the same time with M42. Isolating it in the eyepiece helps the cloud pop out a little bit more because M42 is so large and bright. Very circular in shape.

---

## M44 - The Beehive
**Type:** Open Cluster | **Brightness:** 3.1  
**Date/Time:** 3-15-23, 9:47 EST
