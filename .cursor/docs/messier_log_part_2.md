# Messier Observations (M51-M80)

## M51 - Whirlpool Galaxy
**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 8.4  
**Date/Time:** 3-30-23, 11:07 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 3  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Magnification:** 30.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** With the 25mm eyepiece, not a lot of contrast but it allowed me to see star patterns to verify. Tiny target to spot even if this galaxy is on its side. Unfortunately galaxies tend to be the least interesting visually and are just slight smudges in the sky.

## M52 - Salt-and-Pepper Cluster
**Type:** Open Cluster

**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 3  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Barlow:** 2x | **Magnification:** 60.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Took much patience scanning the sky. Eventually identified nearby stars to positively id the fuzzy elongated patch that is this target. Could identify two nearby stars that my astro software doesn't have a name for.

## M64 - Black Eye Galaxy
**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 8.5  
**Date/Time:** 4-18-23, 10:57 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 25mm | **Magnification:** 30.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Elongated fuzzy that leans to the right in the eyepiece. A Lyriad meteor went through the middle of the eyepiece when observing this target. This galaxy, being higher in the sky, was noticeably easier to spot than M106 I observed earlier in the evening. Observed with 10mm Plossl too.

## M65
**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 9.1  
**Date/Time:** 3-15-23, 11:18 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 4  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** High in the sky, therefore a darker sky and a bit more contrast. M65 is very thin. Made finding this and nearby M66 easier to find than other observations tonight.

## M66
**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 8.9  
**Date/Time:** 3-15-23, 11:18 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 4  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** A little bigger and brighter than nearby M65. Still very faint and without structure in the scope though.

## M67 - King Cobra Cluster
**Type:** Open Cluster  
**Brightness:** 6.9  
**Date/Time:** 3-15-23, 9:38 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 4  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad

## M68
**Type:** Globular Cluster  
**Brightness:** 7.7  
**Date/Time:** 5-10-23, 12:59 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Generally brighter than galaxies but still a dense smudge. Positioned the Telrad 3 times according to the star chart in "110 Things to See..." book, and every time found the same object. Glad to see star clusters again after all those galaxies.

## M69
**Type:** Globular Cluster  
**Brightness:** 7.6  
**Date/Time:** 7-11-23, 1:36 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 14mm | **Magnification:** 53.6x

**Eyepiece:** 10mm | **Barlow:** 2x | **Magnification:** 150.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** M73 does pop out because of the lack of nearby stars. The four bright stars look like a pizza slice to me.

## M74 - Phantom Galaxy
**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 9.4  
**Date/Time:** 10-22-24, 11:39 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 5  
**Eyepiece:** 24mm | **Magnification:** 75.0x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** All but the faintest of faint smudges in the sky. Low contrast with no structure visible to me. Nearby stars are very dim which made it hard to find patterns. Took two seasons and 8-10 nights to finally see.

## M75
**Type:** Globular Cluster  
**Brightness:** 8.5  
**Date/Time:** 8-15-23, 10:01 EST  
**Location:** SM Soccer Fields (35.161, -85.372)  
**Seeing:** G | **Transparency:** 6  
**Eyepiece:** 16mm | **Barlow:** 2x | **Magnification:** 93.8x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Like M54, very tight cluster making it look like an unfocused star. At the high magnification a brighter core emerges with fuzzy disc around it.

## M76 - Little Dumbbell Nebula
**Type:** Planetary Nebula  
**Brightness:** 10.1  
**Date/Time:** 10-10-23, 8:26 EST  
**Location:** Standing Stone SP (36.47, -85.41)  
**Seeing:** E | **Transparency:** 7  
**Eyepiece:** 9mm | **Magnification:** 83.3x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** Looks like a little pill with a heavier left side in the eyepiece. O3 filter made the dumbbell shaped structure evident to the eyes.

## M77 - Cetus A
**Type:** Spiral Galaxy  
**Brightness:** 8.9  
**Date/Time:** 12-6-23, 9:57 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)  
**Seeing:** VG | **Transparency:** 4  
**Eyepiece:** 9mm | **Magnification:** 83.3x  
**Finder:** Telrad  
**Notes:** M77 looked perfectly round with a tight bright core. In the eyepiece around the core the rest of the galaxy resembled the halo you see around bright objects when obscured by haze. Research prior to observing M77 indicated that along with a foreground star nearby can easily be mistaken for a double star. I could immediately see how that could be the case.

## M78 - Casper the Friendly Ghost
**Type:** Reflection Nebula  
**Brightness:** 8.3  
**Date/Time:** 2-13-23, 9:23 EST  
**Location:** Home (35.150, -85.326)
