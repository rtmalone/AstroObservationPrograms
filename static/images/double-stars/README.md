# Double Star Images

This directory contains observation sketches and photographs for the Double Star Program.

## Image Naming Convention

Images should be named using the star name in lowercase with hyphens:
- `eta-cassiopeiae.jpg`
- `gamma-andromedae.jpg`
- `alpha-geminorum.jpg`
- etc.

## Image Requirements

- Format: JPG, PNG, or similar
- Recommended size: 800x600 or larger
- Can include:
  - Telescope photographs
  - Eyepiece sketches (scanned or photographed)
  - Annotated images showing position angles
  - Comparison images showing separation

## Placeholder

Until you add your own images, the site will show broken image links. You can either:
1. Add actual observation images/sketches as you observe each star
2. Create a generic placeholder image named for each star
3. Comment out the image section in individual pages until images are ready
