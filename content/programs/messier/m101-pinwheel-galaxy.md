## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Visually larger than other galaxies. Can't see structures. Surprisingly dim considering I have seen dimmer targets more easily.

### Additional Notes
Hopped from Mizar & Alcor to find this target. Finally after 2-3 attempts on other nights. Had to wait for clouds to pass. Observed with 10mm Plossl too. Used Telrad finder.
