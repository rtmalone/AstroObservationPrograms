## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
About average size and fuzzy. A couple brighter stars share the view.

### Additional Notes
Waxing gibbous moon washes out the view a bit but is far from the target. Misidentified Enif at first for star hopping, but after correcting easy enough to find. Used Telrad finder.
