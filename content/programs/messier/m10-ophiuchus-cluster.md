## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Just a fuzzy spot though, can't make out the stars in cluster. A little fuzzier than M12 that was found nearby even though it is technically brighter; presumably because it is lower in the sky altitude wise.

### Additional Notes
Used Telrad finder to locate this object.
