## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Very tiny object and very faint too. But looks like a flattened circle.

### Additional Notes
Still surprisingly easy to find with the observation tips from John Read's 110 Things to See With a Telescope book and the sky quality tonight. Used Telrad finder.
