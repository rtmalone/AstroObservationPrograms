## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
The stars in the actual cluster seem pretty small and sparse.

### Additional Notes
Looked at the wrong side of C Hya for a long time in an attempt to star hop. After correcting, immediately found M48. Confirmed by panning back to 1,2, and C Hya. Used Telrad finder.
