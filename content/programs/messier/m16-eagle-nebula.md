## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Fainter nebula than others I've observed on the Messier list. But the O III filter helps define the cloud. Looks triangular. There are a few visible stars in the cloud and even those are not as bright as others within nebula.

### Additional Notes
The Pillars of Creation! J/k, can't see but still exciting. Used Telrad finder.
