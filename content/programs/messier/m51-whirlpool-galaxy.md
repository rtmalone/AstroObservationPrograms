## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
With the 25mm eyepiece, not a lot of contrast but it allowed me to see star patterns to verify. Tiny target to spot even if this galaxy is on its side.

### Additional Notes
Unfortunately galaxies tend to be the least interesting visually and are just slight smudges in the sky. Used Telrad finder.
