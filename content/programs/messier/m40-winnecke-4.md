## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Yep, just two stars hanging out together; rather dim.

### Additional Notes
Identifies object via surrounding star pattern. Interestingly, I note Stellarium has the magnitude of these two an order dimmer than the book I'm using for the Messier list has them. Used Telrad finder.
