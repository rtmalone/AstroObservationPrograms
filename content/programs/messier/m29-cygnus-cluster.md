## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
At first the brightest stars in the cluster looked like an upside down basket. Then I noticed the common name for this DSO - The Cooling Tower. Yep, that's what it looks like.

### Additional Notes
Dense surrounding starfield with relatively bright stars. Used Telrad finder.
