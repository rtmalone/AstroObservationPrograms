## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
M77 looked perfectly round with a tight bright core. In the eyepiece around the core the rest of the galaxy resembled the halo you see around bright objects when obscured by haze.

### Additional Notes
Research prior to observing M77 indicated that along with a foreground star nearby can easily be mistaken for a double star. I could immediately see how that could be the case. Used Telrad finder.
