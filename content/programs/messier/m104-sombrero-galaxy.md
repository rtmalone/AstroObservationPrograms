Could still see the sombrero personality of this galaxy even though it's a faint smudge.

## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Even though these galaxies are almost always faint smudges, I could still see the sombrero personality of this galaxy.

### Additional Notes
Using observation tips from 110 Things To See With A Telescope I pretty much got dead on the target. I identified the nearby asterism called "The Pistol" to positively identify. Used Telrad finder.
