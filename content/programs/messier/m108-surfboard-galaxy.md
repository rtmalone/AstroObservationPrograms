## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
I found the faintest of faint smudge and confirmed by a pattern of stars nearby I was looking at M108.

### Additional Notes
Found nearby Owl Nebula with an O III filter and starting with a 25mm eyepiece I knew I had M108 in the view but couldn't see any of its photons yet. I used every trick I could including using my knit cap as a makeshift eye patch to preserve night vision. It worked! Observed with a 10mm and a 2x barlow as well. Used Telrad finder.
