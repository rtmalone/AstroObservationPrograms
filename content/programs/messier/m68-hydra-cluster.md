# M68 - Hydra Cluster

Globular cluster that's brighter than galaxies but still a dense smudge. Relief after galaxy observations!

## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Generally brighter than galaxies but still a dense smudge.

### Additional Notes
Positioned the Telrad 3 times according to the star chart in "110 Things to See..." book, and every time found the same object. Glad to see star clusters again after all those galaxies. Used Telrad finder.
