## Object Information

The Great Orion Nebula is one of the brightest and most studied emission nebulae in the sky. Located in Orion's sword, M42 is visible to the naked eye as a fuzzy patch and reveals incredible detail through telescopes of any size.

## What to Look For

- The Trapezium cluster at the nebula's heart (four bright stars)
- Diffuse nebulosity extending in all directions
- Dark dust lanes creating structure within the nebula
- The "wings" of the nebula extending north and south
- Use averted vision to see fainter extensions
- OIII filter enhances contrast significantly

## Observing Notes

- Best observed: Winter months (December-March)
- Visibility: Excellent from northern and southern hemispheres
- Recommended magnification: 50-150x
- One of the most rewarding deep-sky objects for all skill levels
