## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Typical nice bright center of stars, but the outer diffused stars are not as uniform. Looks like a dark shape eats into the bottom (in the eyepiece) of the cluster. Most surrounding stars are few and faint. Except for two: a gold star at 2:00 relative to M30 and a smaller blue star at 9:00.

### Additional Notes
Used Telrad finder to locate this object.
