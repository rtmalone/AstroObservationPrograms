## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Elongated fuzzy that leans to the right in the eyepiece.

### Additional Notes
A Lyriad meteor went through the middle of the eyepiece when observing this target. This galaxy, being higher in the sky, was noticeably easier to spot than M106 I observed earlier in the evening. Observed with 10mm Plossl too. Used Telrad finder.
