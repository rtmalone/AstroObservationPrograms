# Kepler

A young, bright crater on Oceanus Procellarum with a prominent ray system visible at full moon.

---

## Visual Description

Kepler appeared as a bright, well-defined crater on the dark expanse of Oceanus Procellarum. Despite its relatively small size, the crater was prominent due to its brightness and fresh appearance. The walls showed clear terracing and a small central peak was visible on the floor. The crater's youth was evident in its pristine structure.

## Notable Features

- Bright, fresh appearance
- Terraced walls
- Small central peak
- Extensive ray system (visible near full moon)
- Young crater age

## Notes

- Named after German astronomer Johannes Kepler
- Best observed 11-13 days after new moon (structure) or full moon (rays)
- Only about 800 million years old
- Coordinates: 8.1°N, 38.0°W
- One of the prominent ray craters
