Copernicus appeared as a brilliant, prominent crater on Mare Imbrium, immediately catching the eye. The crater showed magnificent terraced walls with multiple levels rising high above the floor. A complex central peak system was visible even with binoculars. The crater's youth was evident in its pristine structure and bright appearance.
