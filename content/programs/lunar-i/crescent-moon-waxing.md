# Crescent Moon, Waxing

A waxing crescent moon, the phase between new moon and first quarter when less than half the visible disk is illuminated.

---

## Visual Description

The waxing crescent moon appeared in the evening western sky as a beautiful thin arc of light. The illuminated portion showed a smooth, bright curve with the terminator (day-night line) clearly visible. Earthshine was also visible on the dark portion, giving the entire lunar disk a subtle presence against the darkening sky.

## Notable Features

- Thin crescent shape, illuminated on right side (western limb)
- Bright, smooth curve with sharp terminator
- Earthshine visible on dark portion
- Visible in evening western sky after sunset
- Increasing illumination each night

## Notes

- Occurs 1-7 days after new moon
- Illumination increases from 0% to 50% during this phase
- "Waxing" means growing or increasing
- Best observed shortly after sunset
- Excellent for seeing earthshine
