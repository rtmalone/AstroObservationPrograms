# Mare Vaporum

The Sea of Vapors, a small lunar mare located between Mare Serenitatis and Mare Tranquillitatis.

## Visual Description

Mare Vaporum appeared as a roughly circular dark patch situated between the larger Mare Serenitatis to the north and Sinus Medii to the south. The mare displayed the typical smooth, dark basaltic surface characteristic of lunar maria, though it was notably smaller than the major maria surrounding it. The crater Manilius formed a prominent bright feature on its northern edge, providing a useful landmark for locating this relatively small mare.

## Notable Features

- Small circular mare basin
- Dark, smooth lava plain
- Located between major maria

- Name means "Sea of Vapors"
- One of the smaller named maria
- Best observed 7-9 days after new moon
- Coordinates: 13.3°N, 3.6°E
- Visible with binoculars, details require telescope
