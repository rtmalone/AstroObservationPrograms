# Catharina

The southernmost and oldest crater in the famous triple-crater chain near Mare Nectaris.

---

## Visual Description

Catharina appeared as the most degraded of the three craters in the chain, showing its ancient age. The walls were lower and more worn than Theophilus or Cyrillus, and the floor was heavily cratered with multiple impacts. The crater demonstrated the effects of billions of years of bombardment, with a complex, irregular floor.

## Notable Features

- Most degraded of the triple-crater formation
- Heavily cratered floor with multiple impacts
- Lower, worn walls compared to northern neighbors
- Complex interior structure
- Oldest crater in the Theophilus-Cyrillus-Catharina chain

## Notes

- Named after Saint Catherine of Alexandria
- Best observed 6-8 days after new moon
- Excellent example of an ancient, modified crater
- Coordinates: 18.0°S, 23.6°E
- Demonstrates lunar crater evolution over time
