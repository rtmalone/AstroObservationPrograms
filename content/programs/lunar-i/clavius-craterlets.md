# Clavius Craterlets

A prominent curved chain of progressively smaller craters on the floor of the giant crater Clavius.

---

## Visual Description

The Clavius craterlets appeared as a graceful arc of craters sweeping across the floor of the massive crater Clavius. The chain consisted of several craters decreasing in size from Rutherford (the largest) through Porter, and continuing to progressively smaller craters, creating a distinctive curved pattern. This feature was easily visible in moderate telescopes and served as a classic test of telescope resolution and seeing conditions, with observers attempting to resolve the smallest craters in the chain.

## Notable Features

- Curved chain of progressively smaller craters
- Located on Clavius crater floor
- Rutherford is largest crater in chain
- Classic telescope resolution test
- Graceful arc pattern

## Notes

- Famous among lunar observers as resolution test
- Chain includes Rutherford, Porter, and smaller craters
- Best observed 8-10 days after new moon
- Located within Clavius at 58.4°S, 14.4°W
- Number of craters visible indicates telescope quality
