# Reiner Gamma

One of the Moon's most prominent albedo features—a bright swirl on Oceanus Procellarum with no associated topography.

---

## Visual Description

Reiner Gamma appeared as a bright, tadpole-shaped marking on the dark surface of Oceanus Procellarum. Unlike typical bright features that are craters or mountains, this feature was purely a difference in surface brightness (albedo) with no associated relief or topography. The swirl showed intricate curved patterns resembling a giant comma or tadpole shape. This unusual feature remained bright at all sun angles, unlike typical lunar highlands that appear less prominent at high sun.
