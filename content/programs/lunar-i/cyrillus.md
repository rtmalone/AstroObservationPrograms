# Cyrillus

The middle crater in the spectacular triple-crater chain, showing signs of age and modification.

---

## Visual Description

Cyrillus appeared as a large crater between Theophilus to the north and Catharina to the south. The crater showed more degradation than Theophilus, with its northern rim broken and overlapped by the younger Theophilus. The walls displayed terracing, and multiple small craters were visible on the floor. The crater's age was evident in its less pristine appearance.

## Notable Features

- Northern rim disrupted by Theophilus impact
- Complex, irregular crater floor with smaller craters
- Visible terracing on inner walls
- Part of the famous triple-crater formation
- Shows intermediate age between Theophilus and Catharina

## Notes

- Named after Saint Cyril of Alexandria
- Best observed 6-8 days after new moon
- Good example of crater modification by later impacts
- Coordinates: 13.2°S, 24.0°E
- Older than Theophilus but younger than Catharina
