# Lunar Rays

Bright streaks of ejected material radiating from impact craters, most prominent around full moon.

---

## Visual Description

The lunar ray systems appeared as bright, radial streaks extending across the lunar surface from several major impact craters. The most prominent rays emanated from Tycho in the southern highlands, stretching for hundreds of kilometers across both maria and highlands. Copernicus also displayed spectacular rays extending northward and southward. The rays appeared brightest at high sun angles (near full moon) when their high albedo material reflected sunlight most effectively.

## Notable Features

- Bright streaks radiating from impact craters
- Most prominent from Tycho and Copernicus
- Extend for hundreds of kilometers
- Best visible at full moon (high sun angle)
- Composed of bright ejecta material

## Notes

- Rays indicate relatively young craters
- Formed from material ejected during impact
- Overlay older features, showing relative age
- Best observed 12-15 days after new moon
- Some ray systems visible with binoculars
