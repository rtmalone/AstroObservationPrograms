# Woman in the Moon

An alternative pareidolia pattern seeing a woman's profile or figure in the lunar maria.

---

## Visual Description

The full moon's pattern of dark maria and bright highlands can be interpreted as a woman's profile or figure. Some observers see a woman with flowing hair, with Mare Crisium forming the face in profile, and the western maria creating the impression of hair or a dress. This alternative interpretation of the lunar features demonstrates how the same geological features can suggest different images to different observers.

## Notable Features

- Mare Crisium as facial profile
- Western maria as flowing hair or garment
- Alternative pareidolia to "Man in the Moon"
- Pattern visible at full moon
- Requires imagination and cultural context

## Notes

- Less universally recognized than "Man in the Moon"
- Shows cultural variation in lunar interpretation
- Best observed during full moon phase
- Same maria features as other patterns
- Profile orientation depends on viewing angle
