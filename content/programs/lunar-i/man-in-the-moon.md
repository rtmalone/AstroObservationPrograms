# Man in the Moon

The pareidolia pattern of dark maria forming the appearance of a human face on the full moon.

---

## Visual Description

The full moon displayed the classic "Man in the Moon" pattern, with Mare Imbrium and Mare Serenitatis forming the eyes, Mare Nubium suggesting a nose, and the curved shape of Mare Cognitum and Oceanus Procellarum creating the outline of a mouth. The dark maria contrasted sharply against the bright lunar highlands, creating a face-like pattern visible to the naked eye that has been recognized across cultures for millennia.

## Notable Features

- Mare Imbrium and Mare Serenitatis as "eyes"
- Mare Nubium region as "nose"
- Western maria forming "mouth" area
- Pattern most obvious at full moon
- Universal cultural recognition of face pattern

## Notes

- Classic example of pareidolia (seeing patterns in random features)
- Different cultures see different patterns in same features
- Best observed during full moon phase
- Pattern formed by impact basin flooding with lava
- Northern hemisphere view shows upright face
