A crater in the central highlands notable for the prominent catena (crater chain) on its floor.

---

## Visual Description

Davy appeared as a moderately sized crater in the highlands region west of Mare Nubium. The most distinctive feature was Catena Davy, a remarkable chain of small craters crossing the crater's floor, likely formed by the impact of a fragmented comet or asteroid. The main crater showed worn walls and a floor marked by this unusual linear feature, making it one of the Moon's most interesting examples of secondary crater chains.

## Notable Features

- Crater with prominent floor catena
- Catena Davy crosses crater floor
- Worn crater walls
- Located west of Mare Nubium
- Classic example of crater chain

## Notes

- Named after English chemist Humphry Davy
- Catena Davy is prominent telescopic feature
- Best observed 9-10 days after new moon
- Coordinates: 11.8°S, 8.1°W
- Excellent target for crater chain observation
