# Cassini A

A small crater located on the floor of the larger crater Cassini, creating a distinctive crater-within-crater formation.

---

## Visual Description

Cassini A appeared as a small, well-defined crater situated on the floor of the much larger crater Cassini. This crater-within-crater formation created an interesting nested appearance, with Cassini A's sharp rim and dark floor contrasting with the lighter floor of parent crater Cassini. The feature demonstrated the ongoing bombardment history of the lunar surface, with the younger Cassini A impacting the floor of the older Cassini long after its formation.

## Notable Features

- Crater within larger Cassini crater
- Sharp, well-preserved rim
- Dark crater floor
- Classic nested crater formation
- Shows relative age relationships

## Notes

- Located within crater Cassini
- Demonstrates multiple impact events
- Best observed 8-10 days after new moon
- Coordinates: 40.2°N, 4.6°E
- Requires moderate magnification to resolve
