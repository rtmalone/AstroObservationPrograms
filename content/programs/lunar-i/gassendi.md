# Gassendi

A spectacular floor-fractured crater on the northern rim of Mare Humorum with an extensive rille system.

---

## Visual Description

Gassendi appeared as a prominent crater overlapping the northern edge of Mare Humorum. The crater walls were well-defined, with the southern wall partially flooded by mare lava. The floor was notably complex with hints of rilles and ridges visible even at low magnification. A central peak complex was visible on the floor.

## Notable Features

- Large floor-fractured crater
- Complex rille system on floor (telescopic highlight)
- Overlaps Mare Humorum
- Multiple central peaks
- Partially lava-flooded southern wall

## Notes

- Named after French astronomer Pierre Gassendi
- Best observed 10-12 days after new moon
- The floor rilles are a famous telescopic challenge
- Coordinates: 17.5°S, 40.1°W
- One of the finest floor-fractured craters
