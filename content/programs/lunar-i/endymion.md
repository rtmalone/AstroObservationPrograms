# Endymion

A large crater with a distinctively dark, flat floor near the Moon's northeastern limb.

---

## Visual Description

Endymion appeared as a large crater with a notably dark, smooth floor - one of the darkest crater floors on the Moon. The contrast between the dark lava-filled floor and the bright surrounding highlands was striking. The crater walls were well-defined and appeared to rise significantly above the floor.

## Notable Features

- Exceptionally dark, flat floor (lava-filled)
- Large diameter with prominent walls
- Located near the northeastern limb
- Smooth floor contrasting with bright highlands
- One of the darkest crater floors visible

## Notes

- Named after Endymion from Greek mythology
- Best observed 3-5 days after new moon
- The dark floor makes it easily identifiable
- Coordinates: 53.6°N, 57.0°E
- Subject to libration effects due to position near limb
