# Alphonsus

The middle crater in the Ptolemaeus-Alphonsus-Arzachel chain, famous for dark-halo craters.

## Visual Description

Alphonsus appeared as a well-defined crater between the larger Ptolemaeus to the north and Arzachel to the south. The crater showed good wall preservation with visible terracing. The floor contained a small central peak and several dark patches. The crater demonstrated intermediate features between the ancient Ptolemaeus and younger Arzachel.

## Notable Features

- Central peak on crater floor
- Dark-halo craters (volcanic vents) on floor
- Part of prominent three-crater chain
- Rille system on floor (telescopic)
- Evidence of volcanic activity

## Notes

- Named after King Alfonso X of Castile
- Best observed 8-10 days after new moon
- Famous for dark-halo impact craters (pyroclastic deposits)
- Coordinates: 13.4°S, 2.8°W
- Ranger 9 impacted here in 1965
