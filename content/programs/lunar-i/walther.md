## Notable Features

- Large but heavily degraded structure
- Complex floor with multiple craters
- Overlapping crater walls
- Located in ancient southern highlands
- Shows extreme modification from impacts

## Notes

- Named after German astronomer Bernhard Walther
- Best observed 8-10 days after new moon
- Excellent example of extreme crater degradation
- Coordinates: 33.1°S, 1.0°E
- Part of heavily cratered southern terrain
