# Hipparchus

A large, ancient crater in the central highlands, heavily modified by subsequent impacts.

---

## Visual Description

Hipparchus appeared as a large but heavily degraded crater with low, worn walls barely rising above the surrounding terrain. The floor was complex and crowded with numerous smaller craters, showing the effects of billions of years of impacts. The crater's great age was evident in its subdued appearance.

## Notable Features

- Very large diameter but low walls
- Heavily cratered floor with multiple impacts
- Ancient, degraded structure
- Located in the lunar central highlands
- Demonstrates extreme age and modification

## Notes

- Named after ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus
- Best observed 7-9 days after new moon
- Excellent example of an ancient, saturated crater
- Coordinates: 5.5°S, 4.8°E
- One of the oldest visible crater structures
