# Crescent Moon, Waning

A waning crescent moon, the phase between last quarter and new moon when less than half the visible disk is illuminated.

---

## Visual Description

The waning crescent moon appeared in the eastern sky before sunrise as a thin arc of light. The illuminated portion showed a smooth curve on the left side (eastern limb) with the terminator clearly visible. Earthshine softly illuminated the dark portion of the disk, creating a ghostly full circle visible against the brightening twilight sky.

## Notable Features

- Thin crescent shape, illuminated on left side (eastern limb)
- Bright curve with distinct terminator
- Earthshine on dark portion
- Visible in eastern sky before sunrise
- Decreasing illumination each morning

## Notes

- Occurs 1-7 days before new moon
- Illumination decreases from 50% to 0% during this phase
- "Waning" means shrinking or decreasing
- Best observed before sunrise
- Morning crescent often shows dramatic earthshine
