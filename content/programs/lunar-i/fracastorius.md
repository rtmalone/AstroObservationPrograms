# Fracastorius

A distinctive crater on the southern shore of Mare Nectaris with its northern wall breached by lava.

---

## Visual Description

Fracastorius appeared as a semi-circular crater on the southern edge of Mare Nectaris, with its northern wall completely breached and flooded by mare lava. Only the southern and side walls remained intact, creating a distinctive bay-like formation. The floor was dark and level with the adjacent mare surface.

## Notable Features

- Northern wall completely breached and flooded
- Dark, flat floor continuous with Mare Nectaris
- Semi-circular shape forming a bay
- Remaining walls show good preservation
- Excellent example of mare flooding

## Notes

- Named after Italian physician and astronomer Girolamo Fracastoro
- Best observed 6-8 days after new moon
- Classic example of a "ghost crater" or flooded crater
- Coordinates: 21.5°S, 33.0°E
- Demonstrates mare lava interactions with craters
