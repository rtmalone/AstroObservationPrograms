# Cleomedes

A large crater north of Mare Crisium with complex floor features.

---

## Visual Description

Cleomedes appeared as a prominent crater with irregular walls and a complex floor containing smaller craters and ridges. The crater was well-defined against the surrounding highlands, with the northern wall showing some degradation. The floor appeared darker than the surrounding terrain.

## Notable Features

- Large diameter with complex interior
- Contains several smaller craters on the floor
- Dark floor contrasting with bright walls
- Located just north of Mare Crisium
- Irregular wall structure

## Notes

- Named after Greek astronomer Cleomedes
- Best observed 3-5 days after new moon
- Look for the crater chain on the floor
- Coordinates: 27.7°N, 55.5°E
- Interesting target for studying crater complexity
