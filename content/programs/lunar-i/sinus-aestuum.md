The Bay of Billows, a mare region located south of Copernicus and west of the central highlands.

## Visual Description

Sinus Aestuum appeared as an irregular dark patch of mare material situated between the bright crater Copernicus to the north and the central highland region. The bay showed a relatively smooth surface typical of mare basalt, though less uniform than the major maria. The feature connected to Sinus Medii to the east and served as part of the mare system in the central nearside region.
