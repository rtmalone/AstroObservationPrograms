# Langrenus

A prominent crater near the eastern limb, visible early in the lunar cycle.

## Visual Description

Langrenus appeared as a bright, distinct crater with prominent terraced walls. The central peak complex was visible, and the crater showed excellent detail along the terminator where shadows enhanced the relief. The crater's ray system was subtle but present.

## Notable Features

- Large terraced walls showing impact structure
- Prominent central peak complex
- Located near Mare Fecunditatis
- Ray system extending from the crater
- Deep, well-preserved crater floor

## Notes

- Named after Belgian astronomer Michel Langrenus
- Best observed 3-5 days after new moon
- Excellent target for observing crater morphology
- Coordinates: 8.9°S, 61.1°E
- Crater depth: approximately 2.7 km
