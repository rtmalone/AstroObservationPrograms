A prominent crater in the southeastern highlands, notable for its terraced walls and association with crater Metius.

## Visual Description

Fabricius appeared as a well-defined crater in the southern highlands, located adjacent to the similar-sized crater Metius to the south. The crater displayed relatively well-preserved walls with some terracing visible on the inner slopes. The floor appeared relatively flat with some smaller impacts visible. Fabricius and Metius together formed a prominent pair in the southeastern quadrant, easily identified when near the terminator.

## Notable Features

- Well-preserved crater structure
- Terraced inner walls
- Paired with crater Metius
- Relatively flat floor
- Located in southern highlands

## Notes

- Named after Dutch astronomer David Fabricius
- Part of a prominent crater pair
