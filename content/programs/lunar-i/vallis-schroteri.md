# Vallis Schroteri

Schröter's Valley, the largest sinuous rille on the Moon, beginning near the crater Herodotus.

---

## Visual Description

Vallis Schroteri appeared as a dramatic winding valley in the Aristarchus plateau region, starting with the distinctive "Cobra Head" feature near crater Herodotus and meandering northward for 168 km. The rille showed a characteristic sinuous path with varying width, typical of lunar sinuous rilles formed by ancient lava channels. The valley floor appeared darker than the surrounding plateau, and the feature was most prominent when near the terminator due to the shadows cast by its walls.
