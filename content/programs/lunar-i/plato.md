# Plato

A distinctive crater with a dark, flat floor on the northern shore of Mare Imbrium.

---

## Visual Description

Plato appeared as one of the most recognizable features on the Moon - a large crater with a remarkably flat, dark lava-flooded floor contrasting sharply with bright surrounding highlands. The crater's nearly circular outline and smooth interior made it immediately identifiable. The walls appeared prominent and well-defined.

## Notable Features

- Distinctive dark, flat floor (lava-filled)
- Nearly perfect circular outline
- Prominent walls rising sharply from the floor
- Located on the northern edge of Mare Imbrium
- One of the most easily recognizable craters

## Notes

- Named after Greek philosopher Plato
- Best observed 8-10 days after new moon
- Dark floor contains several tiny craterlets (telescopic challenge)
- Coordinates: 51.6°N, 9.3°W
- Classic landmark for lunar observers
