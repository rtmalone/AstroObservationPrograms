# Promontorium Laplace

A prominent cape or promontory on the northern rim of Sinus Iridum, part of the Montes Jura mountain range.

---

## Visual Description

Promontorium Laplace appeared as a bright, angular projection extending into the dark surface of Sinus Iridum from the northern rim. This promontory formed part of the spectacular Montes Jura arc that borders the Bay of Rainbows. When the terminator crossed this region, the promontory cast dramatic shadows and, along with Promontorium Heraclides to the south, created part of the famous "Jeweled Handle" effect at lunar sunrise.

## Notable Features

- Northern cape of Sinus Iridum
- Part of Montes Jura mountain arc
- Bright highland material
- Dramatic shadows when near terminator
- Component of "Jeweled Handle" effect

## Notes

- Named after French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace
- Part of Imbrium Basin rim structure
- Best observed 9-11 days after new moon
- Coordinates: 46.0°N, 25.8°W
- Spectacular when illuminated at sunrise
