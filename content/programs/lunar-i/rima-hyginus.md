## Visual Description

Rima Hyginus appeared as a linear valley or rille cutting across the mare region between Mare Vaporum and Sinus Medii. The most distinctive feature was the small crater Hyginus at the rille's center, creating a characteristic "beads on a string" appearance with smaller craterlets along the rille's length. The rille appeared as a dark linear feature, representing a collapsed lava tube or graben structure.
