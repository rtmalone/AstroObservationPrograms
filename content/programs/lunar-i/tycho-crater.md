# Tycho Crater

One of the Moon's most prominent and spectacular craters, the center of a brilliant ray system.

---

## Visual Description

Tycho appeared as a brilliant, prominent crater in the southern highlands with dramatic terraced walls rising high above the crater floor. The central peak complex was clearly visible even with binoculars. The crater's youth was immediately evident in its sharp, pristine features and bright appearance. When observed near the terminator, the walls cast deep shadows highlighting the crater's impressive depth.

## Notable Features

- Spectacular multi-level terraced walls
- Prominent central peak complex
- Extensive ray system (best at full moon)
- Sharp, well-defined crater rim
- One of the youngest large craters
- Brilliant white appearance

## Notes

- Named after Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe
- Best observed 9-11 days after new moon (structure) or full moon (rays)
- Only about 108 million years old
- Coordinates: 43.3°S, 11.2°W
- Ray system extends over 1,500 km across the Moon
- Crater depth approximately 4.8 km
