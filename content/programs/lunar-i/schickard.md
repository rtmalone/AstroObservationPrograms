## Visual Description

Schickard appeared as an enormous crater in the southwestern region of the Moon, one of the largest craters visible on the nearside. The most distinctive feature was its floor, which showed patches of both dark mare material and lighter highland material, creating a mottled appearance. The crater walls were relatively low and worn, consistent with its great age. The combination of size and distinctive floor patterns made Schickard one of the most recognizable features in the southwestern quadrant.
