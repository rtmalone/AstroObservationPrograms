## Visual Description

Clavius appeared as one of the largest and most impressive craters in the southern highlands. The crater's immense size was immediately apparent, with massive walls enclosing a complex floor. Even with binoculars, a curved chain of progressively smaller craters was visible crossing the floor, creating one of the Moon's most distinctive crater patterns.

## Notable Features

- One of the largest craters visible (231 km diameter)
- Famous arc of craters across the floor (Porter, Rutherfurd, Clavius D)
- Massive terraced walls
- Complex floor topography
- Featured in the film "2001: A Space Odyssey"

## Notes

- Named after German mathematician Christopher Clavius
- Best observed 9-11 days after new moon
- The crater arc is a classic telescopic sight
- Coordinates: 58.4°S, 14.4°W
- Crater depth approximately 3.5 km
