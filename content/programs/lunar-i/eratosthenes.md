# Eratosthenes

A prominent crater marking the boundary between Mare Imbrium and the Montes Apenninus range.

---

## Visual Description

Eratosthenes appeared as a deep, well-preserved crater at the southern end of the Montes Apenninus mountain range. The crater showed excellent terraced walls and a prominent central peak complex. Its strategic location at the edge of Mare Imbrium made it a prominent landmark, and the crater's relatively young age was evident in its sharp, well-defined features.

## Notable Features

- Excellent terraced walls with multiple levels
- Prominent central peak complex
- Located at terminus of Montes Apenninus
- Deep crater with well-preserved structure
- Strategic location between mare and highlands

## Notes

- Named after Greek mathematician Eratosthenes
- Best observed 9-10 days after new moon
- Marks the boundary of Mare Imbrium
- Coordinates: 14.5°N, 11.3°W
- Used to define geological periods (Eratosthenian Era)
