# Oceanus Procellarum

The Ocean of Storms is the largest dark feature on the Moon, covering much of the western near side.

---

## Visual Description

Oceanus Procellarum appeared as the vast, irregular dark region dominating the western half of the Moon's near side. Unlike the circular maria, this feature has an irregular shape and connects to several other maria. The surface shows variations in tone and numerous small craters dot the vast lava plain.

## Notable Features

- Largest dark feature on the Moon's near side
- Irregular shape, not a true circular impact basin
- Contains numerous prominent craters including Aristarchus and Kepler
- Multiple Apollo landing sites (12, 14) within this region
- Shows complex volcanic history with overlapping flows

## Notes

- Name means "Ocean of Storms"
- Apollo 12 landed here in 1969 (Surveyor 3 site)
- Best observed 10-13 days after new moon
- Home to the bright crater Aristarchus
- Coordinates: 18.4°N, 57.4°W
