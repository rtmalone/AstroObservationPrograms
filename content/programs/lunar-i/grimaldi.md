# Grimaldi

A large crater with one of the darkest floors on the Moon, located near the western limb.

---

## Visual Description

Grimaldi appeared as a large crater with an exceptionally dark, flat floor - one of the darkest areas on the entire lunar surface. The floor's darkness rivaled that of the darkest maria. The crater walls were prominent but relatively low, and the floor appeared smooth and featureless, having been flooded by ancient lava flows.

## Notable Features

- One of the darkest floors on the Moon
- Very large diameter
- Flat, smooth lava-filled floor
- Located near the western limb
- Easily identifiable due to dark floor

## Notes

- Named after Italian astronomer Francesco Grimaldi
- Best observed 12-14 days after new moon
- The dark floor makes it unmistakable
- Coordinates: 5.2°S, 68.6°W
- Subject to libration effects near the limb
