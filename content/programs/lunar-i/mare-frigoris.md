# Mare Frigoris

The Sea of Cold is a long, narrow mare stretching across the northern part of the Moon's near side.

---

## Visual Description

Mare Frigoris appeared as an elongated dark band stretching east-west across the northern lunar highlands. Unlike the circular maria, this feature is linear and irregular, connecting several dark patches. The mare floor is less uniform than other maria, showing variations in tone and texture.

## Notable Features

- Linear mare extending nearly 1,600 km east-west
- Connects Mare Imbrium and Mare Serenitatis regions
- Irregular boundaries with multiple embayments
- Contains the prominent crater Aristoteles on its southern border
- Less uniform surface than circular maria

## Notes

- Name means "Sea of Cold"
- Not a true impact basin like circular maria
- Best observed 6-8 days after new moon
- Look for the contrast with surrounding bright highlands
- Coordinates: 56.0°N, 1.4°E
