# Vendelinus

A large, ancient crater showing significant degradation from subsequent impacts.

---

## Visual Description

Vendelinus appeared as a large but heavily worn crater with low, degraded walls. The crater floor showed several smaller impact craters and irregular features. Unlike younger craters, the rim was not sharp but rounded and broken in places by overlapping craters.

## Notable Features

- Ancient, heavily eroded crater
- Low, degraded walls with gaps
- Multiple small craters on the floor
- Shows effects of billions of years of impacts
- Less distinct than nearby younger craters

## Notes

- Named after Flemish astronomer Govaert Wendelen
- Best observed 4-5 days after new moon
- Good example of an ancient, degraded crater
- Coordinates: 16.4°S, 61.6°E
- Contrast with nearby pristine craters is instructive
