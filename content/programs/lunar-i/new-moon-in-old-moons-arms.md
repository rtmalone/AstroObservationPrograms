The phenomenon where earthshine illuminates the dark portion of a waning crescent moon before sunrise.

---

## Visual Description

The waning crescent moon displayed earthshine in the morning twilight, with the thin bright crescent accompanied by the dimly glowing dark portion of the lunar disk. This "new moon" (crescent) held in the "old moon's arms" (earthshine) created a beautiful predawn sight, with Earth's reflected light gently illuminating the unlit portion.

## Notes

- Requires clear morning skies
- Morning earthshine can be as dramatic as evening
- Visible to naked eye, enhanced with binoculars
