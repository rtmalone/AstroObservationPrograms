# Pitatus

A large crater on the southern shore of Mare Nubium, notable for its partially flooded floor and system of rilles.

---

## Visual Description

Pitatus appeared as a large crater on the southern edge of Mare Nubium, with a floor that had been partially flooded by lava, creating a smooth, dark surface. The northern wall was partially breached where lava from Mare Nubium flowed into the crater. The floor showed a delicate system of rilles visible under good seeing conditions, along with some low hills. The contrast between the dark flooded floor and the bright crater rim created a striking appearance.

## Notable Features

- Large crater, partially lava-flooded floor
