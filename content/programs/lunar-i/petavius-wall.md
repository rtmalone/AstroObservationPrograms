# Petavius Wall

The impressive terraced wall system of Petavius crater, one of the Moon's most spectacular crater wall structures.

---

## Visual Description

The walls of Petavius displayed magnificent terracing and structural complexity, rising dramatically from the crater floor. The terraced inner walls showed multiple concentric steps formed by slumping during and after the impact event. These terraces were particularly prominent on the western wall, creating a series of parallel ridges descending to the crater floor. The wall structure was most impressive when near the terminator, with shadows emphasizing the three-dimensional architecture.

## Notable Features

- Spectacular terraced wall structure
- Multiple concentric steps and ridges
- Western wall shows best terracing
- Dramatic when near terminator
- Classic example of crater wall slumping

## Notes

- Part of the large Petavius crater system
- Best example of terraced walls on the Moon
- Best observed 3-5 days after new moon
- Coordinates: 25.3°S, 60.4°E (crater center)
- Requires good seeing to resolve details
