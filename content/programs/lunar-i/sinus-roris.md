The Bay of Dew, a small mare region in the northwestern quadrant of the Moon's nearside.

---

## Visual Description

Sinus Roris appeared as a small, dark irregular patch in the northwestern region of the visible Moon, located between Oceanus Procellarum and the lunar limb. The bay showed a smooth, dark mare surface connected to Oceanus Procellarum to the south. Its position near the limb made it subject to libration effects, sometimes appearing more or less prominent depending on the Moon's orientation.

## Notable Features

- Small bay in northwestern quadrant
- Connected to Oceanus Procellarum
- Irregular shape with smooth floor
- Near the lunar limb, affected by libration
- Dark mare material contrasting with highlands

## Notes

- Name means "Bay of Dew"
- Located in a less frequently observed region
- Best viewed during favorable libration
- Coordinates: 54.0°N, 56.6°W
- Visible with telescope, challenging with binoculars
