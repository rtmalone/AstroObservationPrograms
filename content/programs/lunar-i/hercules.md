# Hercules

A well-formed crater immediately south of Atlas, featuring a central peak and terraced walls.

---

## Visual Description

Hercules appeared as a well-defined crater just south of the larger Atlas. The crater showed excellent wall detail with visible terracing, and a small central peak was detectable. The floor appeared brighter and less complex than Atlas, providing a nice contrast between the two adjacent craters.

## Notable Features

- Well-preserved crater with terraced walls
- Small but distinct central peak
- Cleaner, less cluttered floor than Atlas
- Forms prominent pair with Atlas to the north
- Located near Mare Frigoris

## Notes

- Named after the hero Heracles (Hercules) from Greek mythology
- Best observed 4-6 days after new moon
- The size difference with Atlas makes for an interesting comparison
- Coordinates: 46.7°N, 39.2°E
- Good example of a well-preserved crater
