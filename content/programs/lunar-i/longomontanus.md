# Longomontanus

A large crater in the southern highlands near Clavius, showing significant age and modification.

---

## Visual Description

Longomontanus appeared as a large crater in the southern highlands with prominent but degraded walls. The crater floor was complex with several smaller craters and irregular features. Adjacent to the massive Clavius to the southwest, Longomontanus showed intermediate preservation - not as fresh as Tycho but better preserved than some ancient neighbors.

## Notable Features

- Large diameter with complex floor
- Multiple craters on the floor
- Located near Clavius
- Terraced walls showing some degradation
- Southern highlands location

## Notes

- Named after Danish astronomer Christian Longomontanus
- Best observed 9-11 days after new moon
- Good comparison with nearby Clavius
- Coordinates: 49.5°S, 21.8°W
- Ancient crater showing significant modification
