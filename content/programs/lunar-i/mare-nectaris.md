The Sea of Nectar is a small, circular mare in the southeastern quadrant of the Moon.

---

## Visual Description

Mare Nectaris appeared as a well-defined, roughly circular dark area. The mare has a distinctive shape with the dramatic triple-crater complex of Theophilus, Cyrillus, and Catharina on its northwestern edge. The floor is relatively smooth and uniform in tone.

## Notable Features

- Nearly circular mare basin
- Bordered by the impressive Theophilus crater complex
- Part of the Nectaris Basin impact structure
- Rupes Altai scarp visible to the southeast
- Smooth, dark lava floor

## Notes

- Name means "Sea of Nectar"
- Best observed 5-7 days after new moon
- Look for the Rupes Altai scarp forming a curved mountain arc
- The Theophilus crater overlaps the mare edge
- Coordinates: 15.2°S, 35.5°E
