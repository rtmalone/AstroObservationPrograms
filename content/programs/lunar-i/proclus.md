Proclus appeared as an exceptionally bright crater on the western edge of Mare Crisium, standing out dramatically against both the dark mare and surrounding highlands. The crater displayed a sharp rim and bright interior, indicating its relative youth. Most distinctive was its asymmetric ray system, with bright rays extending primarily to the south and west, while notably absent to the north and east—an unusual pattern suggesting an oblique impact angle.
