# J. Herschel

A large crater in the northern highlands near the north pole, notable for its size and position.

---

## Visual Description

J. Herschel appeared as a large crater in the far northern region of the Moon, located south of the crater South. Due to its high latitude, the crater was subject to foreshortening and appeared increasingly oval-shaped when viewed from Earth. The crater showed signs of age with degraded walls and a floor containing several smaller impacts. Its position near the limb made it challenging to observe but added to its interest for dedicated lunar observers.

## Notable Features

- Large crater in northern highlands
- Near lunar north pole region
- Degraded walls show age
- Floor contains smaller craters
- Foreshortened appearance due to latitude

## Notes

- Named after British astronomer John Herschel
- Located in rarely observed northern region
- Best observed 9-11 days after new moon
- Coordinates: 62.1°N, 41.2°W
- Requires favorable libration for best view
