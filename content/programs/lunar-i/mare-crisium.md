# Mare Crisium

A prominent, isolated dark mare visible even to the naked eye near the Moon's eastern limb.

---

## Visual Description

Mare Crisium appeared as a distinct, roughly oval dark patch near the eastern edge of the Moon. Due to foreshortening from our viewing angle, this circular mare appears elongated north-south, though it's actually elongated east-west. The mare has a well-defined border with the surrounding highlands.

## Notable Features

- Dark, smooth lava plain contrasting with bright highlands
- Nearly isolated from other maria
- Appears oval due to perspective near the limb
- Prominent craters Picard and Peirce visible on the mare floor

## Notes

- One of the easiest maria to identify
- Visible early in the lunar cycle (around first quarter)
- Best observed 3-5 days after new moon
- Coordinates: 17.0°N, 59.1°E
