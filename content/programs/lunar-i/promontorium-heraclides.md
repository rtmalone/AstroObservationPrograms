A prominent cape or promontory on the western rim of Sinus Iridum, famous for the "Moon Maiden" profile.

---

## Visual Description

Promontorium Heraclides appeared as a bright triangular projection extending into Sinus Iridum from the western rim. This promontory formed the southern horn of the Montes Jura arc bordering the Bay of Rainbows. Under certain lighting conditions, the promontory showed a profile resembling a woman's head with flowing hair, known as the "Moon Maiden" or "Lunar Lady." When near the terminator, it contributed to the spectacular "Jeweled Handle" effect along with other peaks in the Jura Mountains.
