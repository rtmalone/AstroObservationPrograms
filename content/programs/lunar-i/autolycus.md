# Autolycus

A small but prominent crater on Mare Imbrium, south of Aristillus.

---

## Visual Description

Autolycus appeared as a compact, well-formed crater on the dark mare surface. Though smaller than nearby Aristillus, the crater was distinct with sharp walls and a relatively flat floor. The crater formed a notable geometric arrangement with Aristillus to the north and Archimedes to the west.

## Notable Features

- Small but well-preserved structure
- Sharp, distinct rim
- Located on Mare Imbrium
- Part of the famous Archimedes-Aristillus-Autolycus triangle
- Relatively flat floor without central peak

## Notes

- Named after Greek astronomer Autolycus of Pitane
- Best observed 7-9 days after new moon
- Excellent landmark for locating Archimedes and Aristillus
- Coordinates: 30.7°N, 1.5°E
- Smaller companion to Aristillus
