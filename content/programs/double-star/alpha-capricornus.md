## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Another golden pair. Their separation is so far I thought Alpha 2 was the primary because of a very faint star near that one in the EP. The true pair is just very far apart.

### Additional Notes
*Any other observations, challenges encountered, or notable details about this observation session*
