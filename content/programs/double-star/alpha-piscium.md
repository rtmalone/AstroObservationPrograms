## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
Alpha Piscium is white in color.

### Additional Notes
With my very best and highest magnification EP I could not split this pair. I know I was on target however since A Piscium is easy to find in the constellation. I also confirmed the EP view in Stellarium.
