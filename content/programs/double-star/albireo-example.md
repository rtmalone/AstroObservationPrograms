# Beta Cygni (Albireo)

One of the most beautiful double stars in the sky. The color contrast between the golden primary and blue secondary is stunning even at low power.

---

## Visual Description

At 48x magnification, the pair was easily split with a wide, comfortable separation. The primary star appeared a rich golden-amber color, while the companion shone with a distinct sapphire blue hue. The contrast was immediately obvious and striking.

## Position Angle Estimation

Using the drift method, I estimated the position angle at approximately 50-55°, very close to the cataloged value of 54°.

## Notes

- Colors were vivid even without averted vision
- Separation wide enough for binoculars
- One of my favorite double stars for showing newcomers
- No optical aid needed to appreciate the contrast
- Temperature: 68°F, perfect observing conditions
