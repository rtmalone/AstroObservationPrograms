## Observation Notes

### Visual Description
The four stars of Theta 1 are nice and sharp and bluish white. Partly that color because of the nebula cloud?

### Additional Notes
Was initially unsure about which star to calculate PA with. Had to ask the program director how to figure that out when the "double" star contains more than two stars in the group.
