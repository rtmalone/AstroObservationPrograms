progress: "0/100 features observed"
image: "/images/placeholder-lunar.svg"
summary: "Advanced lunar observing requiring 100 additional challenging features. Focus on smaller craters, domes, rilles, and subtle formations. Lunar I completion required."
---

The Lunar II Program is the advanced continuation of the Lunar I Program, requiring observation of an additional 100 more challenging lunar features. This program focuses on smaller, more subtle features that require careful observation and good seeing conditions.

## Program Requirements

- Must have completed Lunar I Program first
- Observe 100 additional designated lunar features
- Features are generally smaller and more challenging than Lunar I
- Record detailed observations with sketches recommended
- Requires systematic observation across multiple lunar phases

## Progress

Currently observed: 0/100 features (0%)
*Note: Lunar I Program must be completed first*

## Observation Challenges

- Many features require excellent seeing conditions
- Optimal lighting angles are critical for visibility
- Some features are only visible under specific illumination
- Requires patience and multiple observation sessions
- Sketching skills become more important for documentation

## Equipment Recommendations

- Minimum 6" telescope recommended
- 8" or larger preferred for challenging features
- High-quality eyepieces for sharp views
- Stable mount essential for high magnification work
- Detailed lunar atlas required for feature identification

## Observation Strategy

- Plan observations around optimal lighting for specific features
- Use multiple magnifications to study feature details
- Take advantage of excellent seeing nights
- Consider lunar photography to supplement visual observations
- Keep detailed observation logs with sketches
