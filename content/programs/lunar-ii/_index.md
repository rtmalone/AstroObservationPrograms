The Lunar II Program is the advanced continuation of the Lunar I Program, requiring observation of an additional 100 more challenging lunar features. This program focuses on smaller, more subtle features that require careful observation and good seeing conditions.

## Program Requirements

- Must have completed Lunar I Program first
- Observe 100 additional designated lunar features
- Features are generally smaller and more challenging than Lunar I
- Record detailed observations with sketches recommended
- Requires systematic observation across multiple lunar phases

## Progress

Currently observed: 0/100 features (0%)
*Note: Lunar I Program must be completed first*
