My first successful observation of the Great Orion Nebula. Even in light-polluted skies, the nebulosity was clearly visible surrounding the Trapezium cluster.

## Visual Description

The nebula appeared as a bright, diffuse cloud with the four stars of the Trapezium easily resolved at 80x magnification. Averted vision revealed more extensive nebulosity extending to the north and south.

## Notes

- Used OIII filter to enhance contrast
- The "wings" of the nebula were faintly visible
- Temperature: 45°F, light wind
